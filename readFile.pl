%%  read_file
%%  This is a modified version for parsing pddl files.
%%  Read the input file character by character and parse it
%%  into a list. Brackets, comma, period and question marks
%%  are treated as separate words. White spaces separe words.
%%
%%  Similar to read_sent in Pereira and Shieber, Prolog and
%%      Natural Language Analysis, CSLI, 1987.
%%
%%  Examples:
%%      :- read_file('input.txt', L).
%%      input.txt > The sky was blue, after the rain.
%%      L = [the, sky, was, blue, ',', after, the, rain, '.']
%%
%%      :- read_file('domain.pddl', L).
%%      domain.pddl >
%%          (define (domain BLOCKS)
%%          (:requirements :strips :typing :action-costs)
%%          (:types block)
%%          (:predicates (on ?x - block ?y - block)
%%          ...
%%      L = ['(', define, '(', domain, blocks, ')', '(', :, requirements|...].
